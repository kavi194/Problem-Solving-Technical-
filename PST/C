Q(1) Hima and Anni have 30 oranges together, but hima has 10  oranges more than Anni. How many oranges does each of the girls have?
Jessy said without thinking: Hima has 20 oranges and Anni 10 oranges. The Mom tried to check if Jessy answer wasn't accidental and repeated the riddle every time increasing the numbers. Every time Jessy answered correctly. The surprised Mom wanted to continue questioning Jessy, but with big numbers she could't solve the problem. Help the Mom .

Write a program which reads from standard input the number of oranges the girls have together and how many more oranges Hima has,counts the number of oranges belonging to Hima and the number of oranges belonging to Anni,

Example:
Input:
30
10
Output:
20 10

Code:
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int total,difference;
    int hima,jessy;
    printf("enter the total orange:");
    scanf("%d",&total);
    printf("enter the difference:");
    scanf("%d",&difference);
    hima = (total+difference)/2;
    jessy = total - hima;
    printf("hima has:%d\n",hima);
    printf("jessy has:%d",jessy);
    return 0;
}

Q(2) Design a login screen with username and password, where username and password will be authenticated with given hard coded username and password. While entering password, password character will display even backspace and delete will work

Sample out:
Enter User Name: user001
Enter Password:******
LOGIN SUCCESS. 

Code:
#include<stdio.h>
#include<string.h>
int main()
{
    int i,j;
    char UN,PW;
    char username [5][10] = {"Kaviarasi","Mathimitha","Renuka","Praveena","Preethi"};
    char password [5][8] = {"12345670","12345672","12345673","12345674","12345675"};
    printf("enter your username:");
    scanf("%s",&UN);
    printf("enter your password:");
    scanf("%d",&PW);
    for(i=0;i<4;i++)
    {
        if(strcmp(UN,username[i])==0 && strcmp(PW,password[i])==0)
        {
            printf("Your login is successfully...!!");
            break;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}

Q(3) Jack and Jill are playing a string game. Jack has given Jill two strings A and B. Jill has to derive a string C from A, by deleting elements from string A, such that string C does not contain any element of string B. Jill needs help to do this task. She wants a program to do this as she is lazy. Given strings A and B as input, give string C as Output.
Example 1:
•	Input:
tiger     -> input string A
ti          -> input string B
•	Output:
ger       -> Output string C
•	Explanation:
After removing “t” and “i” from “tiger”, we are left with “ger”.
So, the answer is “ger”.

Code:
#include<stdio.h>
void main()
{
    char a[10]={"NULL"},b[10]={"NULL"};
    int i,j;
    printf("enter the string1: ");
    gets(a);
    printf("enter the string2: ");
    gets(b);
    for(i=0; i<10; i++)
    {
        for(j=0;j<10;j++){
        if(a[i]==b[j])
        {
            a[i]=0;
        }
        }
    }
    printf("Expected output:");
    for(i=0; i<10; i++)
    {
        printf("%c",a[i]);
    }
    return 0;
}

Q(4) The function accepts two integers n, m as arguments Find the sum of all numbers in range from 1 to m(both inclusive) that are not divisible by n. Return difference between sum of integers not divisible by n with sum of numbers divisible by n.
Assumption:
•	n>0 and m>0
•	Sum lies between integral range
Example
Input
n:4
m:20
Output
90

Explanation
•	Sum of numbers divisible by 4 are 4 + 8 + 12 + 16 + 20 = 60
•	Sum of numbers not divisible by 4 are 1 +2 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 17 + 18 + 19 = 150
•	Difference 150 – 60 = 90

Sample Input
n:3
m:10
Sample Output
19

Code:
#include<stdio.h>
int differenceofSum(int n, int m)
{
    int i, sum1 = 0, sum2 = 0;
    for(i=1; i<=m; i++)
    {
        if(i%n==0)
        {
            sum1 = sum1 + i;
        }
        else
        {
            sum2 = sum2 + i;
        }   
    }
    return sum2 - sum1;
}
int main()
{
    int n, m;
    int result;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    scanf("%d",&m);
    result = differenceofSum(n, m);
    printf("%d",result);
    return 0;
}
